# Prototype-Guided Classification Sub-Task Decoupling Framework: Enhancing Generalization and Interpretability for Multivariate Time Series

This repository provides the official implementation of the proposed prototype-guided classification framework for multivariate time series classification.

# Repository Structure

The codebase is organized to clearly separate data processing, model definition, prototype mechanisms, and experimental pipelines, facilitating reproducibility and extensibility.
